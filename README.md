# API Project (Ecommerce)

## Objectives
To develop API-based websites to simulate the functionalities of e-commerce
services among different organisations.
## Description
In this project, we simulate the e-commerce functionalities among different
organisations. We consider three different organisations: an e-commerce
organisation, a backend product supplier which supplies required products
to the e-commerce organisation and a Bank to facilitate transactions between different
entities within this eco-system.
